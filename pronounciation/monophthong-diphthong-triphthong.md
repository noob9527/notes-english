# monophthong, diphthong and triphthong
### Syllable
Vowels can be monophthongs, diphthongs or triphthongs. To understand these terms you must first understand what a syllable is, and the best way to explain that is with an example.
Say each of these words to yourself:
- Mouse (1 syllable)
- Rabbit (2 syllables)  
- Kangaroo (3 syllables)
- Barracuda (4 syllables)
- Hippopotamus (5 syllables)

Any word must have at least one syllable; even the word ‘a’ has one syllable. A word has two syllables when there are two vowel sounds divided by a consonant sound, or, to put it another way, two vowel sounds connected by a consonant sound. A word has three syllables when there are three vowel sounds divided/connected by two consonant sounds. And so on. 

### Monophthongs, Diphthongs & Triphthongs
Now that you understand what a syllable is we can look at monophthongs and diphthongs. A monophthong is where there is one vowel sound in a syllable, and a diphthong is where there are two vowel sounds in a syllable.  
Say the word ‘funny’ out-loud. As you can hear, in ‘funny’ we have two vowel sounds – 
ʌ and i – divided into two syllables by the consonant sound n. So we can say that ‘funny’ contains two monophthongs: ʌ and i.  
Now say the word ‘guy’. Here we have the same two vowel sounds but this time they are stuck together in one syllable, without any consonant dividing them. So we can say that ‘guy’ contains one diphthong: ʌi. To put it simply: a monophthong is a single vowel and a diphthong is a double vowel.  
In English we also have a couple of triple vowels called triphthongs, such as in the word ‘fire’, which has three vowels ʌ, ɪ and ə stuck together in one syllable: fʌɪə.
