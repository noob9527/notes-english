Qingdao is in an extraordinary location on the Jiaozhou Bay. it is also a **major** naval base since **waning([weɪn])** Qing empire. Historically, Qingdao was occupied by German, and then by Japan. That's why you can find a lot of surviving German, Japan flavored constructions there.\
Since they decided to turn QingDao a Tourism city, naturally, there are lots of things to do there. from what I can remember, I had visited several **Aquariums([əˈkweriəm])**, **naval([ˈneɪv(ə)l])** museums, **maritime([ˈmerəˌtaɪm])** museums there. there are also some famous scenery spot located there, such as Lu Xun Park, Zhongshan Park and Mountain Lao, which is the most famous **Taoist(['taʊɪst])** mountain.

### corrected
Beautiful beach, heavenly cool climate, cheap seafood: this is what I think of when I remember the lovely seaside city of Qingdao in East China and, of course, the famous Qingdao beer.
Qingdao is in an extraordinary location on the Jiaozhou Bay. It is also a major naval base since the waning years of the Qing empire. Historically, Qingdao was occupied by the Germans and later on by the Japanese; that’s why you can find numerous surviving German and Japanese style structures there.
Since the Germans and the Japanese decided to turn Qingdao into a tourist city, naturally, there are lots of things to do there. From what I remember (As far as I can remember), I had visited several aquariums, as well as naval and maritime museums there. There are also some famous scenic spots there, such as Lu Xun Park, Zhongshan Park and Mountain Lao, which is the most famous Taoist mountain. After all, if you ask me what my most liked activity was, I would say I’d rather hang out on the beach all day.
Of course, Qingdao has its problems. Back when I visited Qingdao, there was a notorious scandal called Xinjiang nut cake scandal. It was said that if you tried to buy nut cakes from Xinjiang people, you would have had money extorted from you. To this day, I don’t know what the real truth is. 
In my opinion, Qingdao is just like any other tourist city in China; they all share the same problems and characteristics. To put it simply, there might have been artificial scenic spots built to attract tourists. Some places may let tourists feed the animals or put up animal shows to please/entertain tourists. Furthermore, some locals may behave overly hospitable because they want your money, not to mention the crowdedness in such places. To sum up, this is why I don’t like travelling. After all, no place can cheer me up with all the annoying people walking around, but as long as I’m with the right people, I can be happy anywhere.
