# acronym vs abbreviation
they can be used interchangeably in common English, but have specific (and different) meanings when used in mathematics.

> An acronym (as the term is commonly used) is a term that is formed from the initial letters of some longer name and is pronounced differently than the expanded form. Examples of acronyms as the term is commonly used:
- FBI, which stands for Federal Bureau of Investigation, but is pronounced ef-bee-I
- NATO, which stands for North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but is pronounced NAY-toe
- IUPAC, which stands for International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, but is pronounced I-U-pak
An abbreviation is written differently from the expanded form but is pronounced the same. Examples:
- Mr., which stands for mister and is pronounced mister
- ft., which stands for feet and is pronounced feet
- etc., which stands for et cetera and is pronounced et cetera
- e.g., which stands for exempli gratia
