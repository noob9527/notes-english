Beautiful beach, heavenly cool climate, cheap seafood, this is what I think of when I remember the lovely seaside city of Qingdao in east China, and of course the famous QingDao beer as well.\
Qingdao is in an extraordinary location on the Jiaozhou Bay. it is also a **major** naval base since **waning([weɪn])** Qing empire. Historically, Qingdao was occupied by German, and then by Japan. That's why you can find a lot of surviving German, Japan flavored constructions there.\
Since they decided to turn QingDao a Tourism city, naturally, there are lots of things to do there. from what I can remember, I had visited several **Aquariums([əˈkweriəm])**, **naval([ˈneɪv(ə)l])** museums, **maritime([ˈmerəˌtaɪm])** museums there. there are also some famous scenery spot located there, such as Lu Xun Park, Zhongshan Park and Mountain Lao, which is the most famous **Taoist(['taʊɪst])** mountain. After all, if you ask me which was my most liked activity, I would say I would rather hang out on the beach all day.\
Of course, QingDao had its problems, Back to the time I visited Qingdao, There was a notorious scandal which accuses the Xinjiang people who sell Nut cake on the street, it said if you tried to buy cakes from them, you would be extorted. Anyway, I hadn't found out the truth.\
Besides, In my opinion, just like other Chinese tourism cities, they all share the same problems, you can almost smell the smell of Chinese tourism places. to make it concret, they may build artificial scenery spots to attract tourists. Some places may let tourists to feed the animals, or hold some animal shows to please tourists. Furthermore, some of the local people may behave overly hospitable because they want the money in your pocket. Not to mention the crowd in such places. All adds up, it explains why I don't like traveling. After all, no places can cheer me up with annoying people nearby, and with right people, I feel happy in everywhere.
