### phrase vs collocations
> Phrases are strings of consecutive words. Some phrases (such as "a little while") are common, while others (such as "a diminuative while") are uncommon.
Collocations are words that commonly appear together. Diminuative and while are not collocations - even though the appear in the phrase that I wrote above - because they do not frequently appear together. Unlike phrases, collocations are not necessarily consecutive. For example, something is a collocate of bound because it frequently appears in common phrases such as "something is bound to come along" or "something is bound to turn up," but something and bound are not consecutive words in these phrases.
