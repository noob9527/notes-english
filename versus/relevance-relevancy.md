# relavance vs relevancy

> The words 'relevancy' and 'relevance' are closely related but there is a slight difference in their meanings:
> - Relevance refers to the state or fact of being connected with or bearing upon the matter at hand. It implies a close logical relationship with the topic or subject. For example, "The evidence is highly relevant to the investigation."
> - Relevancy refers more to the quality or degree of being relevant. It is a measure of how relevant something is. For example, "The relevancy of the evidence will be determined by the judge."
> 
> So in short:
> - Relevance is the actual relation or connection to the subject.
> - Relevancy refers to the strength, quality or measure of that relevance.
> 
> Relevancy focuses more on the assessment or evaluation of relevance, whereas relevance simply refers to the existence of a logical connection or relationship. But in many contexts, the words can be used interchangeably.
