## The Zero Conditional
The zero conditional is used for when the time being referred to is now or always and the situation is real and possible. The zero conditional is often used to refer to general truths. The tense in both parts of the sentence is the simple present. In zero conditional sentences, the word "if" can usually be replaced by the word "when" without changing the meaning.

| If clause                 | Main clause           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **If + simple present**   | **simple present**    |
| If this thing happens     | that thing happens.   |
| If you heat ice           | it melts.             |
| If it rains               | the grass gets wet.   |

## The First Conditional
The first conditional is used to refer to the present or future where the situation is real. The first conditional refers to a possible condition and its probable result. In these sentences the if clause is in the simple present, and the main clause is in the simple future.

| If clause                 | Main clause                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **If + simple present**   | **simple future**          |
| If this thing happens     | that thing will happen.    |
| If you don't hurry        | you will miss the train.   |
| If it rains today         | you will get wet.          |

## The Second Conditional
The second conditional is used to refer to a time that is now or any time, and a situation that is unreal. These sentences are not based on fact. The second conditional is used to refer to a hypothetical condition and its probable result. In second conditional sentences, the if clause uses the simple past, and the main clause uses the present conditional.

| If clause                    | Main clause                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **If + simple past**         | **present conditional or present continuous conditional**                |
| If this thing happened       | that thing would happen. (but I'm not sure this thing will happen) OR\   |
|                              | that thing would be happening.                                           |
| If you went to bed earlier   | you would not be so tired.                                               |
| If it rained                 | you would get wet.                                                       |
| If I spoke Italian           | I would be working in Italy.                                             |

## The Third Conditional
The third conditional is used to refer to a time that is in the past, and a situation that is contrary to reality. The facts they are based on are the opposite of what is expressed. The third conditional is used to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable past result. In third conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, and the main clause uses the perfect conditional.

| If clause                              | Main clause                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------     | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------     |
| **If + past perfect**                  | **perfect conditional or perfect continuous conditional**                               |
| If this thing had happened             | that thing would have happened. (but neither of those things really happened) OR\       |
|                                        | that thing would have been happening.                                                   |
| If you had studied harder              | you would have passed the exam.                                                         |
| If it had rained                       | you would have gotten wet.                                                              |
| If I had accepted that promotion       | I would have been working in Milan.                                                     |

## Mixed type conditional
The mixed type conditional is used to refer to a time that is in the past, and a situation that is ongoing into the present. The facts they are based on are the opposite of what is expressed. The mixed type conditional is used to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable result in the present. In mixed type conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, and the main clause uses the present conditional.

| If clause                              | Main clause                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **If + past perfect or simple past**   | **present conditional or perfect conditional**                                          |
| If this thing had happened             | that thing would happen. (but this thing didn't happen so that thing isn't happening)   |
| If I had worked harder at school       | I would have a better job now.                                                          |
| If we had looked at the map            | we wouldn't be lost.                                                                    |
| If you weren't afraid of spiders       | you would have picked it up and put it outside.                                         |

## Exceptions
### Use of the Simple Future in the If-Clause
Generally speaking, the simple future should be used only in the main clause. One exception is when the action in the if-clause will take place after the action in the main clause. For example, consider the following sentence:\
If aspirin will ease my headache, I will take a couple tonight.\
The action in the if-clause is the aspirin easing the headache, which will take place only after the speaker takes them later that night.

### “Were to” in the If-Clause
The verb phrase were to is sometimes used in conditional sentences when the likely or unlikely result is particularly awful or unthinkable. In this case, were to is used to place emphasis on this potential outcome. Consider these sentences:\
If I were to be sick, I would miss another day of work.\
If she were to be late again, she would have to have a conference with the manager.\
If the rent were to have been a penny more, they would not have been able to pay it.\
Note that the emphatic “were to” can be used to describe hypothetical scenarios in the present, future, and past.

### Punctuating Conditional Sentences
Despite the complex nature of conditional sentences, punctuating them properly is really simple!\
Here’s the skinny:\
Use a comma after the if-clause when the if-clause precedes the main clause.\
If I’d had time, I would have cleaned the house.\
If the main clause precedes the if-clause, no punctuation is necessary.\
I would have cleaned the house if I’d had time.
