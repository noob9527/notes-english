# Preposition before Websites or APPs

Generally, we tend to use "on" before web application, "in" before desktop application. e.g.
- How many pictures have you posted on Instagram
- Do you know how to do this effect in Photoshop?
- This is my favorite animation in PowerPoint
- on Facebook/Instagram/Instagram
