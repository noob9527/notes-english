# Restrictive vs Non-Restrictive

- In a restrictive clause, use that.
- In  a nonrestrictive clause, use which.
- Remember, which is as disposable as a sandwich wrapper. If you can remove the clause without destroying the meaning of the sentence, the clause is nonessential (another word for nonrestrictive), and you can use which.

To understand when to use that or which, it’s important to understand clauses. A restrictive clause (also called an essential clause or a defining clause) contains information that is essential to the meaning of the sentence. In American English, only that is used for defining clauses. Here’s an example:

e.g. My bike that has a broken seat is in the garage.

From this sentence, you understand that the speaker has at least one other bike. Specifically, the bike they’re talking about is distinguished from their other bikes by its broken seat. If you removed the clause “that has a broken seat,” you would lose the implication that they own more than one bicycle, and even if you somehow knew about the other bikes, you wouldn’t know which one was in the garage.

Which introduces  nonrestrictive clauses. Unlike restrictive clauses, nonrestrictive clauses (also called nonessential or nondefining clauses) don’t limit the meaning of the sentence. You might lose interesting details if you remove them, but the meaning of the sentence won’t change. These clauses are set off by commas.

e.g. My bike, which has a broken seat, is in the garage.

Here, the broken seat is simply a description of the bike in the garage. There’s no implication that the speaker owns more than one bike.
