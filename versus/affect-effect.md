# affect vs effect
> Is it affect or effect? In a nutshell, affect is a verb and effect is a noun. At least (spoiler alert!), most of the time. In the majority of cases, you’ll encounter the words as these parts of speech.
So, if A affects B, B experiences the effect of A’s action.

### Effect as a Verb
Effect as a verb means to bring about. It usually shows up with nouns like “change” or “solutions.”

### Affect as a Noun

e.g.

- Understanding more about the primary innate affects and the plasticity of the brain has important clinical implications.

### Effective and Affective
