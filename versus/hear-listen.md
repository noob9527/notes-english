# hear vs listen

1. hear
    Hear means able to hear
    - I couldn't hear what she said
    - I can sometimes hear the trains from my bedroom
1. listen (to)
    listen (to) means to pay attention to things you hear
    - I don't know what she said because I wasn't listening
    - I often listen to the early evening news on the television
    - I was listening to the radio when I heard a strange noise outside

Sometimes it is possible to use hear (but not in the progressive form) to mean "listen to"
- I know he's dead -- I heard it on the radio last night. (= I heard it when I was listening)
