# Inversion

### Negative Inversion
In formal styles, when we use an adverb with negative meaning (e.g. never, seldom, rarely, scarcely, hardly) in front position for emphasis, we invert the subject (s) and auxiliary (aux)/modal verb.
Usually, we put the expression at the beginning of the sentence to emphasise what we're saying. It makes our sentence sound surprising or striking or unusual. It also sounds quite formal. If you don't want to give this impression, you can put the negative expression later in the sentence in the normal way.

- Never have we witnessed such cruel behaviour by one child to another. (or We have never witnessed …)
- Seldom does one hear a politician say ‘sorry’. (or One seldom hears …)

In the following expressions, the inversion comes in the second part of the sentence:

- Not until I saw John with my own eyes did I really believe he was safe.
- Not since Lucy left college had she had such a wonderful time.

We only use inversion when the adverb modifies the whole phrase and not when it modifies the noun: 
- Hardly anyone passed the exam. (No inversion.)

### Only Inversion
- Only after I'd seen her flat did I understand why she wanted to live there.
- Only when we'd all arrived home did I feel calm.
- Only by working extremely hard could we afford to eat.
- Only then did he realize the truth.

### So/Such Inversion
- So beautiful was the girl that nobody could talk of anything else. (Normal sentence: the girl was so beautiful that nobody could talk of anything else.)
- So delicious was the food that we ate every last bite. (Normal sentence: the food was so delicious that we ate every last bite.)
- So excited was he that he could not sleep.

### Conditional(Had) Inversion(formal)
- Normal conditional: If I had been there, this problem wouldn't have happened.
  Conditional with inversion: Had I been there, this problem wouldn't have happened.
- Normal conditional: If we had arrived sooner, we could have prevented this tragedy!
  Conditional with inversion: Had we arrived sooner, we could have prevented this tragedy!
- Had I known this earlier, I would not have made that mistake.

### Here and there
Inversion can happen after here, and after there when it is as an adverb of place. After here and there, we can use a main verb without an auxiliary verb or modal verb:

- Here comes the bus!
- Here’s your coffee.
- I opened the door and there stood Michael, all covered in mud.
- She looked out and there was Pamela, walking along arm in arm with Goldie.

### Adverbial Expression Inversion. (formal)
We can use inversion if we put an adverbial expression of place at the beginning on the sentence. This is also quite formal or literary:

- On the table was all the money we had lost. (Normal sentence: All the money we had lost was on the table.)
- Round the corner came the knights. (Normal sentence: The knights came round the corner.)

### "May" inversion in wishes 
- May you have a nice day!
