# while vs whilst vs whereas

### while vs whilst
In British English, while and whilst mean the same when we use them as conjunctions. They both mean ‘during the time that something else happens’, or ‘in contrast with something else’. While is much more common than whilst, and whilst sounds more formal. It is hardly ever used, however, in American English.

### while vs whereas
Whereas means the same as while in sentences expressing contrasts. It does not mean the same as while when while refers to time.
