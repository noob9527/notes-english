# writing and saying numbers

| WRITTEN | SAID |
| ------- | ---- |
| 101 | one hundred and one |
| 121 | one hundred and twenty one |
| 1,001 | one thousand and one |
| 1,101 | one thousand one hundred and one |
| 1,256,721 | one million two hundred fifty-six thousand seven hundred and twenty-one |
| 1,492,638,526 | one billion four hundred ninety-two million six hundred thirty-eight thousand five hundred and twenty-six |

Note:
- The "and" before last number is considered as optional, one thousand one, one hundred one are acceptable, especially in American English.
- When saying large numbers, do not make thousand, million, billion, trillion, etc. plural.\
    Not this:
    ~~twenty thousands dollars; five millions people~~\
    But this:
    twenty thousand dollars; five million people\
    However, they could be plural on their own, e.g. thousands of people; millions of insects.
- In American English a thousand million is a billion, whereas in British English, a thousand million is a milliard.

## reading decimals
Read decimals aloud in English by pronouncing the decimal point as "point", then read each digit individually. Money is not read this way.
| WRITTEN | SAID |
| 0.5 | point five |
| 0.25 | point two five |
| 0.73 | point seven three |
| 0.05 | point zero five |
| 0.6529 | point six five two nine |
| 2.95 | two point nine five |

## reading fractions
Read fractions using the cardinal number for the numerator and the ordinal number for the denominator, making the ordinal number plural if the numerator is larger than 1. This applies to all numbers except for the number 2, which is read "half" when it is the denominator, and "halves" if there is more than one.
| WRITTEN   | SAID |
| --------- | --------------- |
| 1/3       | one third |
| 3/4       | three fourths |
| 5/6       | five sixths |
| 1/2       | one half |
| 3/2       | three halves |

## pronouncing years
Reading years in English is relatively complicated. In general, when the year is a four digit number, read the first two digits as a whole number, then the second two digits as another whole number. There are a few exceptions to this rule. Years that are within the first 100 years of a new millenium can be read as whole numbers even though they have four digits, or they can be read as two two-digit numbers. Millennia are always read as whole numbers because they would be difficult to pronounce otherwise. New centuries are read as whole numbers of hundreds. We do not use the word "thousand", at least not for reading years within the past 1000 years.\
Years that have just three digits can be read as a three digit number, or as a one digit number followed by a two-digit number. Years that are a two digit number are read as a whole number. You can precede any year by the words "the year" to make your meaning clear, and this is common for two and three digit years. Years before the year 0 are followed by BC, pronounced as two letters of the alphabet.\
Interestingly, these rules apply to reading street addresses as well.
| WRITTEN   | SAID |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 2014      | twenty fourteen or two thousand fourteen |
| 2008      | two thousand eight |
| 2000      | two thousand |
| 1944      | nineteen forty-four |
| 1908      | nineteen o eight |
| 1900      | nineteen hundred |
| 1600      | sixteen hundred |
| 1256      | twelve fifty-six |
| 1006      | ten o six |
| 866       | eight hundred sixty-six or eight sixty-six |
| 25        | twenty-five |
| 3000 BC   | three thousand BC |
| 3250 BC   | thirty two fifty BC |

## percentages
26% = twenty-six per cent

## ordinal numbers and dates
One of the problems with dates is that we write them and say them in a different way:\
We write 4 January (or 4th January), but say the fourth of January or January the fourth.\
We write 21 May (or 21st May), but say the twenty-first of May or May the twenty-first.

## Arithmetic
There are four basic processes for working ou t a problem:
- \+ = addition, e.g. 6 + 4 = 10 (six plus/and four equals/is ten)
- \- = addition, e.g. 6 - 4 = 10 (six minus four equals/is two)
- \* = addition, e.g. 6 * 4 = 10 (six times/multiplied by four equals/is twenty-four)
- \/ = addition, e.g. 6 / 4 = 10 (four divided by two equals/is two)

## saying '0'
This can be spoken in different ways in different contexts.\
- telephone number: 693... = six oh three
- mathematics: 0.7 = nought point seven
- football: 2-0 = two nil
- tennis: 40-0 = forty love
